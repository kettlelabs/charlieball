                  <h2>Relieve Back Pain - Anytime, Anywhere</h2>
                  <h4>The evolution of the massage ball in the fight against back pain and muscle tension</h4>
                  <p><strong>San Francisco, California — January 6, 2016 |</strong> Today, ATUS, Corp. – a health and wellness company that creates products for making everyday life a little easier – officially launched in North America with a Kickstarter campaign for the Charlie Ball. The Charlie Ball is a revolutionary redesign in manual massage therapy. Based on the concepts of trigger point therapy and myofascial release, it was designed to provide relief from back pain associated with muscle knots, tension and tightness. Customizable and portable, the Charlie Ball can be used virtually anytime, anywhere.</p>
                  
                  <p>ATUS has a Kickstarter funding goal of $50,000 USD that will be used in the manufacturing and fulfillment of the Charlie Ball.</p>

                  <p>“Being in the Fitness industry for so long, and suffering from nagging sports injuries, I have always been a huge proponent of manual therapies. Our number one priority with the Charlie Ball was to change the pain cycle from - being in pain, taking time off to go see a therapist or practitioner to relieve the pain, then going back to sitting all day and experiencing the pain again. lather rinse repeat.” said Michael LaSala, President & Co-Founder of ATUS. “With the Charlie Ball you can alleviate the pain while you’re in that position that aggravates it and while you continue to go about your day. Giving you more time to do the things you love - like sports, hobbies or spending time with your family.”</p>

                  <p>ATUS has chosen the Charlie Ball as its first consumer product to alleviate common back pain and muscle tension in a more efficient way. The initial prototype was designed to help founder Michael LaSala. “For years I had been unable to sit for extended periods of time without my back acting up, due to many sports injuries. My amazement at how much better my back felt after using the Charlie Ball on long car rides lead me to believe that I had something that could potentially benefit millions of people.”</p>

                  <p>The Charlie Ball is based on the concept of trigger point therapy and myofascial release to treat muscle knots and tightness. Trigger Point Therapy is a technique of applying pressure to an area of adhesion (a knot) in a muscle. The pressure stimulates the adhesion to “let go” relieving tension and tightness in the entire muscle. By focusing the Charlie Ball on adhesions in your back, you can both relieve the pain from the adhesions and provide overall relief of tension and tightness.</p>

                  <p><strong>Convenient:</strong> The Charlie Ball attaches to almost any chair - which means pain relief, any time, anywhere. Unlike other products on the market today, the Charlie Ball addresses the problem where it is most likely to occur - at your desk, in the car or on a plane.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>You have better things to do:</strong> Other massage products take dedicated time. Why spend 20 minutes lying on the floor or wrestling with other handheld products trying to relieve every day aches and pains? With the Charlie Ball you can spend all day treating yourself and feel better getting out of your chair then when you got in.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Easy to Use:</strong> By using your own weight as the means of producing pressure it eliminates the hand and muscle fatigue that is associated with the use of other products. More than one kink in your back? No problem, once the Charlie Ball strapped to your chair, it’ll move freely, so all you need to do is slide it into position.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Always there for you:</strong> Need to go grab something? The Charlie Ball will still be in that ideal position when you get back. The Charlie Ball’s ability to remain suspended in that “perfect spot” allows you to focus on other tasks. Need a break? The Charlie Ball’s patented design allows you to simply slide it off to side until you need again. Then just slide it back into place when you feel your back tightening up again.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Customizable:</strong> You’re unique, so is your pain. The Charlie Ball will come with shells in two densities - hard and soft. You can also combine one half of each shell to create a medium density. You can control the pressure from the Charlie Ball by changing the shell. Initially, we recommend starting with the soft shell. Future generations of the Charlie Ball will include variations in shell density and shape and even custom color options, letting you tailor the Charlie Ball to fit your needs and personality. Making it the perfect design compliment to your home, office or any other place you might need it.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Compact:</strong> The Charlie Ball’s lightweight design makes it easy to carry, simply toss into your purse or carry-on and go.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Multi-Use:</strong> The Charlie Ball also works for sore feet, tight hips and wrist pain. Throw it on the ground, strap it to a wall, the options are limitless.</p>
